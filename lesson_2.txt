Question 2: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make
you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Answer: Learning from mistakes made is an essential part of everyday learning.
In my experience in my professional life, I relaized this truth about learning
from mistakes many times. So to me having an entire history of a file will be
very useful in learning from mistakes. It will also be a very positive feeling
to see that you are making progress when you are able to see the history of
the changes you made. In terms of efficiency having the history might help
incase a change you made did not work out and having the history will help
you not loose the previous working version and save you time from rewriting
the code you had previously written.
