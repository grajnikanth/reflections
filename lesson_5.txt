Question 5: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the
history of files?
Answer: git log command gives a summary of the changes made without detailed
information on the changes. It gives the ids of the commits/versions. Now
using the git diff command only can look at the detailed changes in the
versions like how many lines were changed and exactly what was changed.
