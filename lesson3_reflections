Q) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A) I would use a remote repository when I am collaborating with others on a project, 
or when I want to share my project withrest of the world, or when I am working 
locally on many computers.


Q) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A) If you are working on a project with multiple people, you might want to first look into
the commits performed by others before you adopt them into your local repository.

Q)Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

  A)  Forks are copies of repositories of an original residing on github which
can be modified and the original will not be modified when the commits
are performed on forked versions.
clones are downloaded copies of github repositories to your local computer.
branches are experimental modifications made to your repository which are 
not yet included in your master. These are used for exploring experimental
changes which you are not sure you want to include in your production code
yet.
