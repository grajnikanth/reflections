Question 1: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you
see the bug that was introduced?

Answer: Using the diff command helped locate the bug easily and quickly. The diff
command showed all the line numbers where the content in the two files
differed sequentially. I just had to scroll down to see where I could
spot a typo and since it also showed what was in the previous version at 
that location it helped to quickly see where the typo "spacr" occurred in 
the new version of the file
