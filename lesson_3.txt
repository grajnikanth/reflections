Question 3: What do you think are the pros and cons of maually choosing when
to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically
saved, like Google Docs does?
Answer: The pros with manual commits are that it will be more logical. You can
choose to have manual commits such that all the versions are executable. If
automatic save option is used, then the version might be in the middle of
a change and might not run. The cons are that the manual commits are highly
subjective and one can make error of committing too big versions or too small
versions.
