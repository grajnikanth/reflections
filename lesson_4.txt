Question 4: Why do you think some version conrol systems, like Git, allow
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Goofle Docs, treat
each file separately?
Answer: Git is setup for programming, the other softwares are not setup for
programming so may be that's why these two version controls work differently.
